## List of Gospel Communities:

We at Redeemer Pampa don't want our Sunday morning service to be the apex of our week. Instead it will simply be a part (definitely an important part, but still a just a part) of our week as a family. Gospel Communities (GC's) are another vital part of Redeemer Pampa. Gospel Communities serve as the primary extension of our spiritual family, as we strive to learn to apply the gospel to life. Our GC's meet weekly and are casual gatherings of individuals of different ages, life stages, and family dynamics. A typical gathering will include either a meal/snacks/or a dessert, a deeper look at the previous Sunday's sermon text, prayer, conversation, and community. The goal of our GC's is to see the gospel bear fruit in our lives as both individuals and as a community of people while we disciple one another, pray with/for one another, study scripture, and serve on mission together.
Feel free to contact info.redeemerpampa@gmail.com for more information or email the leader of the group you would like to visit. The groups are open - meaning that new folks are welcome each and every week.

The Redeemer Network is a family of Acts 29 churches mostly in West and Central Texas who are committed to planting and establishing healthy churches together. These churches are tied together by relational trust, theological distinctives (Acts 29), and a desire to plant more churches in collaboration. The Redeemer Network is our primary partner for accomplishing our vision to plant churches. You can learn more about our involvement with the Redeemer Network at (www.redeemernetwork.org).

## Giving

We desire to be generous as a church family - in our time, resources, talents, energy, relationships, and in our finances. We want to be reminded that all of life is worship. We don't want you to give out of compulsion or guilt but instead to give generously, cheerfully as an act of worship and in light of God's abundant generosity (II Corinthians 9:7). Giving stirs our affections for and trust in Jesus as our provider.
In order to best facilitate this we have two options for you to give:
~ There is a basket at the back of the worship area at Redeemer Pampa where you can leave your offering/tithe.
~ You can click here to give online.
Thanks for partnering with us on mission! If you have any questions regarding giving please email us.

## Beliefs

1.  The Scriptures
    We accept the Bible, including the 39 books of the Old Testament and the 27
    books of the New Testament, as the written Word of God. The Bible is the only
    essential and infallible record of God's self-disclosure to mankind. It leads
    us to salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. Being given by God, the
    Scriptures are both fully and verbally inspired by God. Therefore, as
    originally given, the Bible is free of error in all it teaches. Each book is to
    be interpreted according to its context and purpose and in reverent obedience
    to the Lord who speaks through it in living power. All believers are exhorted
    to study the Scriptures and diligently apply them to their lives. The
    Scriptures are the authoritative and normative rule and guide of all Christian
    life, practice, and doctrine. They are totally sufficient and must not be added
    to, superseded, or changed by later tradition, extra-biblical revelation, or
    worldly wisdom. Every doctrinal formulation, whether of creed, confession, or
    theology must be put to the test of the full counsel of God in Holy Scripture.
2.  God Is Triune
    There is one God: infinite, eternal, almighty, and perfect in holiness,
    truth, and love. In the unity of the godhead there are three persons, Father,
    Son and Holy Spirit, co-existent, co-equal, co-eternal. The Father is not the
    Son and the Son is not the Holy Spirit, yet each is truly Deity. One
    God-Father, Son and Holy Spirit-is the foundation of Christian faith and life.
3.  God the Father
    God the Father is the Creator of heaven and earth. By His word and for His
    glory, He freely and supernaturally created the world from nothing. Through the
    same Word He daily sustains all His creatures. He rules over all and is the
    only Sovereign. His plans and purposes cannot be thwarted. He is faithful to every
    promise, works all things together for good to those who love him, and in His
    unfathomable grace gave His Son, Jesus Christ, for mankind's redemption. He
    made man for fellowship with Himself, and intended that all creation should
    live to the praise of His glory.
4.  Jesus Christ
    Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was the eternal Word made flesh,
    supernaturally conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary. He was
    perfect in nature, teaching, and obedience. He is fully God and fully man. He
    was always with God and is God. Through Him all things came into being and were
    created. He was before all things and in Him all things hold together by the
    word of His power. He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all
    creation, and in Him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily. He is the only
    Savior for the sins of the world, having shed His blood and died a vicarious
    death on Calvary's cross. By His death in our place, He revealed the divine
    love and upheld divine justice, removing our guilt and reconciling us to God.
    Having redeemed us from sin, the third day He rose bodily from the grave,
    victorious over death and the powers of darkness and for a period of 40 days
    appeared to more than 500 witnesses, performing many convincing proofs of His
    resurrection. He ascended into heaven where, at God's right hand, He intercedes
    for His people and rules as Lord over all. He is the Head of His body, the
    Church, and should be adored, loved, served, and obeyed by all.
5.  The Holy Spirit
    The Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life, convicts the world of sin,
    righteousness, and judgment. Through the proclamation of the Gospel He
    persuades men to repent of their sins and confess Jesus as Lord. By the same
    Spirit a person is led to trust in divine mercy. The Holy Spirit unites
    believers to Jesus Christ in faith, brings about the new birth, and dwells
    within the regenerate. The Holy Spirit has come to glorify the Son, who in turn
    came to glorify the Father. He will lead the Church into a right understanding
    and rich application of the truth of God's Word. He is to be respected,
    honored, and worshiped as God the Third Person of the Trinity.
6.  Man
    God made man-male and female-in His own image, as the crown of creation, that
    man might have fellowship with him. Tempted by Satan, man rebelled against God.
    Being estranged from His Maker, yet responsible to Him, he became subject to
    divine wrath, inwardly depraved and, apart from a special work of grace,
    utterly incapable of returning to God. This depravity is radical and pervasive.
    It extends to his mind, will, and affections. Unregenerate man lives under the
    dominion of sin and Satan. He is at enmity with God, hostile toward God, and
    hateful of God. Fallen, sinful people, whatever their character or attainments,
    are lost and without hope apart from salvation in Christ.
7.  The Gospel
    Jesus Christ is the Gospel. The good news is revealed in His birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. Christ's crucifixion is the heart of the Gospel, His resurrection is the power of the Gospel, and His ascension is the glory of the Gospel. Christ's death is a substitutionary and propitiatory sacrifice to God for our sins. It satisfies the demands of God's holy justice and appeases His holy wrath. It also
    demonstrates His mysterious love and reveals His amazing grace. Jesus Christ is
    the only mediator between God and man. There is no other name by which men must
    be saved. At the heart of all sound doctrine is the cross of Jesus Christ and
    the infinite privilege that redeemed sinners have of glorifying God because of
    what He has accomplished. Therefore, we want all that takes place in
    our hearts, churches, and ministries to proceed from and be related to the
    cross.
8.  Man's Response to the Gospel
    The message of the Gospel is only effectual to those who genuinely repent of
    their sins and, by God's grace, put saving faith in Christ. This Gospel of
    grace is to be sincerely preached to all men in all nations. Biblical
    repentance is characterized by a changed life, and saving faith is evidenced by
    kingdom service or works. While neither repentance nor works save, unless a
    person is willing to deny himself, pick up His cross, and follow Christ, he
    cannot become His disciple.
9.  Man's Inheritance Through the Gospel
    Salvation, the free gift of God, is provided by grace alone, through faith
    alone, because of Christ alone, for the glory of God alone. Anyone turning from
    sin in repentance and looking to Christ and His substitutionary death receives
    the gift of eternal life and is declared righteous by God as a free gift. The
    righteousness of Christ is imputed to him. He is justified and fully accepted
    by God. Through Christ's atonement for sin an individual is reconciled to God
    as Father and becomes His child. The believer is forgiven the debt of his sin
    and, via the miracle of regeneration, liberated from the law of sin and death
    into the freedom of God's Spirit.
10. Sanctification
    The Holy Spirit is the active agent in our sanctification and seeks to produce
    His fruit in us as our minds are renewed and we are conformed to the image of
    Christ. Though indwelling sin remains a reality, as we are led by the Spirit we
    grow in the knowledge of the Lord, freely keeping His commandments and
    endeavoring to so live in the world that all people may see our good works and
    glorify our Father who is in heaven. All believers are exhorted to persevere in
    the faith, knowing they will have to give an account to God for their every
    thought, word, and deed. The spiritual disciplines, especially Bible study,
    prayer, worship and confession, are a vital means of grace in this regard.
    Nevertheless, the believer's ultimate confidence to persevere is based in the
    sure promise of God to preserve His people until the end, which is most
    certain.
11. The Church
    God by His Word and Spirit creates the Church, calling sinful men out of the
    whole human race into the fellowship of Christ's Body. By the same Word and
    Spirit, He guides and preserves that new redeemed humanity. The Church is not a
    religious institution or denomination. Rather, the Church universal is made up
    of those who have become genuine followers of Jesus Christ and have personally
    appropriated the Gospel. The Church exists to worship and glorify God as
    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It also exists to serve Him by faithfully doing
    His will in the earth. This involves a commitment to see the Gospel preached
    and churches planted in all the world for a testimony. The ultimate mission of
    the Church is the making of disciples through the preaching of the Gospel. When
    God transforms human nature, this then becomes the chief means of society's
    transformation. Upon conversion, newly redeemed men and women are added to a
    local church, in which they devote themselves to teaching, fellowship, the
    Lord's Supper, and prayer.
    All members of the Church universal are to be a vital and committed part of a
    local church. In this context they are called to walk out the New Covenant as
    the people of God, and demonstrate the reality of the kingdom of God. The
    ascended Christ has given gift ministries to the church (including apostles,
    prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers) for the equipping of Christ's
    body that it might mature and grow. Through the gift ministries, all members of
    the Church are to be nurtured and equipped for the work of ministry.
12. Ordinances of the Church
    Water baptism is intended only for the individual who has received the saving
    benefits of Christ's atoning work and has become His disciple. Therefore, in
    obedience to Christ's command and as a testimony to God, the Church, oneself,
    and the world, a believer should be immersed in water in the name of the
    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Water baptism is a visual symbolic demonstration
    of a person's union with Christ in the likeness of His death and resurrection.
    It signifies that his former way of life has been put to death, and vividly
    depicts a person's release from the mastery of sin.
    As with water baptism, the Lord's Supper is to be observed only by those who
    have become genuine followers of Christ. This ordinance symbolizes the breaking
    of Christ's body and the shedding of His blood on our behalf, and is to be
    observed repeatedly throughout the Christian life as a sign of continued
    participation in the atoning benefits of Christ's death. As we partake of the Lord's
    Supper with an attitude of faith and self-examination, we remember and proclaim
    the death of Christ, receive spiritual nourishment for our souls, and signify
    our unity with other members of Christ's body.
13. The Consummation
    The Consummation of all things includes the visible, personal, and glorious
    return of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of the dead and the translation of
    those alive in Christ, the judgment of the just and the unjust, and the
    fulfillment of Christ's kingdom in the new heavens and the new earth. In the
    Consummation, Satan with his hosts and all those outside Christ are finally
    separated from the benevolent presence of God, enduring eternal punishment, but
    the righteous, in glorious bodies, shall live and reign with Him forever. Married
    to Christ as His Bride, the Church will be in the presence of God forever,
    serving Him and giving Him unending praise and glory. Then shall the eager
    expectation of creation be fulfilled and the whole earth shall proclaim the
    glory of God who makes all things new.
