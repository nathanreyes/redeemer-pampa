        We desire to be generous as a church family – in our time, resources, talents, energy, relationships, and in our finances.
        We want to be reminded that all of life is worship. We don’t want you to give out of compulsion or guilt but instead to give generously, cheerfully as an act of worship and in light of God’s abundant generosity (II Corinthians 9:7). Giving stirs our affections for and trust in Jesus as our provider.

        In order to best facilitate this we have two options for you to give:
        <ul>
          <li>There is a basket at the back of the worship area at Redeemer Pampa where you can leave your offering/tithe.</li>
          <li>You can <a href='http://www.easytithe.com/dl/?uid=rede225179' target='_blank' class='link'>click here</a> to give online.</li>
