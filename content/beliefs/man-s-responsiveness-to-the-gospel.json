  "description": "The message of the Gospel is only effectual to those who genuinely repent of their sins and, by Godâ€™s grace, put saving faith in Christ. This Gospel of grace is to be sincerely preached to all men in all nations. Biblical repentance is characterized by a changed life, and saving faith is evidenced by kingdom service or works. While neither repentance nor works save, unless a person is willing to deny himself, pick up His cross, and follow Christ, he cannot become His disciple."
